### Built with

-   SASS
-   CSS BEM Methodology
-   CSS Grid

I don't have the figma file so it is not pixel perfect. I have tried to make similar as same as possible. The website is responsive only 1440px and 375px screen sizes. This project can made with more container/wrapper div elements but I have wanted to use less of it and work with "Grid Areas". I'll be glad if you give me suggestion about mistakes, lackings and best practices and how can I fix it.
